IndexAwesome - Make Apache look awesome!

--

Apache file index pages look like garbage. Your options are either a) create a basic file listing HTML page that looks nicer, or b) deal with it.

The problem with this is: if those file change often, you're going to need it to update often. Really, if all you're looking for is something that looks a little nicer than the default, creating a whole HTML page for it isn't the best solution.

IndexAwesome uses .htaccess files and a sprinkle of CSS to make your Apache index pages look awesome. It's totally customizable, easy to install and the only requirement is you run Apache.

Installation:

	1. Download IndexAwesome from GitHub - http://github.com/mocha/IndexAwesome
	2. Unzip IndexAwesome into a folder.
	3. Name that folder indexawesome
	4. Upload the indexawesome folder in to the root directory of your web server.
		Note: If you host multiple domains on your server, you'll need to upload one copy per domain. It needs to be in the root directory for the domain.
	5. Move the file awesome.htaccess to the root directory as well, outside of the indexawesome folder.
	6. Rename awesome.htaccess to simply .htaccess
	7. Enjoy!
